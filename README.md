# Greater burden of extreme weather events on female mortality: A call to arms for global data equity

This repository includes the data, code script, and figures from the analysis of the corresponding article.

Description:

Are women at higher mortality risk from the effects of climate change? Does sociocultural context matter?  We employ 30 years of extreme temperature exposure data to explore this question in India and call for more granular ambient and personal exposure data for vulnerable subpopulations across the world. Data equity is a critical pillar for achieving health equity, climate equity and more broadly, social equity.
